### Reference Mapping

Reference mapping uses a previously processed and annotated dataset as a reference. Your data is projected into the UMAP coordinates of the reference and the predicted clusters and associated labels are also derived from the reference. 

You can select a reference any time that you generate a new dataset:

- Dataset Import
- Dataset Subset
- Dataset Integration
