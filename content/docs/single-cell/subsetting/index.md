### Specify cells

Select a dataset and click the toggle to open subset controls: 

{{< img-simple src="qc-subset.png" alt="QC Subset" class="border-1" >}}

You can subset based on default QC metrics, saved QC metrics, and clusters.

### Exclude or include selection
Subsetting can be set to either exclude (default) or include cells that match the selected criteria:

Inclusion is usefull for selecting cells of interest to be re-clustered. This will generally increase the number of clusters as highly variable genes will be specific to the selected cells. 

### Custom genes for clustering

You can optionally specify *a priori* [genes of interest](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/feature-selection.html#apriori-hvgs) to focus on specific biologic questions:

### Submit subset

To begin subsetting, add a tag to append to the founder name and click the submit button:
